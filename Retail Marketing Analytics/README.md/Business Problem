An e‑commerce company wants to evaluate how marketing campaigns drive sales. Data arrives daily from multiple sources:

* **Orders** (transactional system – JSON)
* **Customers** (CRM – CSV)
* **Products** (PIM – CSV)
* **Campaign Touches** (ad/clickstream – CSV)

Stakeholders need:

1. A **trustworthy sales star schema** (facts & dims) to power dashboards (Power BI/Databricks SQL).
2. **Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD2)** for Customer to analyze behavior across historical profile changes (e.g., segment or city changes).
3. **Campaign ROI KPIs** (revenue, orders, AOV) by campaign, channel, and date.
